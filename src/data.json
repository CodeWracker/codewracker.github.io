Part of my job involves processing this data on private clusters and on the Google Cloud Platform.  I am also involved in a project for automatic detection of traffic violations using drone images, where I apply the YOLO neural network to identify cars. This project is part of our research and development efforts, exploring the use of AI to enhance accuracy in various areas, including agriculture 4.0."

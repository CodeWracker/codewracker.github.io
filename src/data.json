        "description": "I have been fascinated by electronics since childhood, when I became interested in computers, which is why I became an electronics technician and now, in my undergraduate studies, I have found my passion in the areas of AI and hardware synthesis in FPGAs. In addition to these two areas, I believe that embedded systems, especially with IoT, have great potential.",
